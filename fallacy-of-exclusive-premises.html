      Fallacy of exclusive premises
    </h1>
    <p>
      The fallacy of exclusive premises is a syllogistic formal fallacy committed in a categorical syllogism that is invalid because both of its premises are negative.

      E Proposition: No planets are dogs.<br/>O Proposition: Some dogs are not pets.<br/>O Proposition: Therefore, some pets are not planets.<br/><br/>Explanation of Example 2:<br/><br/>In this example we can more clearly see that the physical difference between a dog and a planet has no correlation to the domestication of dogs. The two premises are exclusive and the subsequent conclusion is nonsense, as the transpose would imply that some pets are planets.<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/><br/>The verisimilitude of the final statement is not relevant in this fallacy. The conclusions in both examples are uncontroversial; however, both are argued on fallacious logic and would not hold up as valid arguments.
