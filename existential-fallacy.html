      Existential fallacy
    </h1>
    <p>
      The existential fallacy, or existential instantiation, is a formal fallacy, where we presuppose that a class has members when we are not supposed to do so; that is, when we should not assume existential import.

      Every unicorn definitely has a horn on its forehead. <br/><br/>It does not imply that there are any unicorns at all in the world, and thus it cannot be assumed that, if the statement is true, somewhere there is a unicorn in the world (with a horn on its forehead). The statement, if assumed true, only implies that if there were any unicorns, each would definitely have a horn on its forehead.
