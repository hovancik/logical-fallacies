      <h1>Informal fallacies</h1>
  <p>
    An informal fallacy occurs when the contents of an argument's stated premises
    fail to adequately support its proposed conclusion.
  </p>
  <p class="italic">
    An argument containing an informal fallacy might employ a valid logical form while nevertheless remaining rationally unpersuasive.
