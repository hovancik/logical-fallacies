  <p>
    A formal fallacy is a pattern of reasoning rendered invalid by a flaw in
    its logical structure that can neatly be expressed in a standard logic system.
  </p>
  <p class="italic">
    An argument that is formally fallacious is always considered wrong.

    An appeal to probability (or appeal to possibility) is the logical fallacy of taking something for granted because it would probably be the case (or might possibly be the case)

    <a href="/argument-from-fallacy.html">Argument from fallacy</a>
  </h2>
  <p>
    Argument from fallacy is the formal fallacy of analyzing an argument and inferring that, since it contains a fallacy, its conclusion must be false.

  <h2>
    <a href="/base-rate-fallacy.html">Base rate fallacy</a>
  </h2>
  <p>
    Base rate fallacy, also called base rate neglect or base rate bias, is a formal fallacy. If presented with related base rate information (i.e. generic, general information) and specific information (information only pertaining to a certain case), the mind tends to ignore the former and focus on the latter.
  </p>
  <h2>
    <a href="/conjunction-fallacy.html">Conjunction fallacy</a>
  </h2>
  <p>
    The conjunction fallacy is a formal fallacy that occurs when it is assumed that specific conditions are more probable than a single general one.
