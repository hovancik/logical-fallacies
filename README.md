## What does it do?
Fallacy.in website is companion website for [logical-fallacies-bot](https://github.com/hovancik/logical-fallacies-bot). The main idea of this bot is to explain logical fallacies on Reddit, when invited to do so by some Reddit user.

Users can do it by using [specific wording](https://fallacy.in/about.html) in their comments, eg. `fallacy in appeal to probability`. Bot will reply to that comment with fallacy explanation. Example can be seen [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fallacybottest/comments/5w3ujc/test/deq1v95/?context=10000).
