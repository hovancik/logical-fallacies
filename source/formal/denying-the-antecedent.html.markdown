title: 'Denying the antecedent'
text: "Denying the antecedent, sometimes also called inverse error or fallacy of the inverse, is a formal fallacy of inferring the inverse from the original statement."
example: 'One way to demonstrate the invalidity of this argument form is with a counterexample with true premises but an obviously false conclusion. For example:<br/><br/>If you are a ski instructor, then you have a job.<br/>You are not a ski instructor.<br/>Therefore, you have no job.<br/><br/>That argument is intentionally bad, but arguments of the same form can sometimes seem superficially convincing.'
