title: 'Argument from fallacy'
text: 'Argument from fallacy is the formal fallacy of analyzing an argument and inferring that, since it contains a fallacy, its conclusion must be false.'
example: 'Tom: All cats are animals. Ginger is an animal. Therefore, Ginger is a cat.<br/>Bill: You have just fallaciously affirmed the consequent. You are incorrect. Therefore, Ginger is not a cat.<br/><br/>Ginger may or may not be a cat. The fact that argument was fallacious is not, in itself, sufficient proof that his conclusion is false.'
