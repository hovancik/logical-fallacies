title: 'Affirming a disjunct'
text: "Affirming a disjunct fallacy lies in concluding that one disjunct must be false because the other disjunct is true; in fact they may both be true because OR is defined inclusively rather than exclusively. It is a fallacy of equivocation between the operations OR and XOR. Affirming the disjunct should not be confused with the valid argument known as the disjunctive syllogism."
example: 'The following argument indicates the unsoundness of affirming a disjunct:<br/><br/>Max is a mammal or Max is a cat.<br/>Max is a mammal.<br/>Therefore, Max is not a cat.<br/><br/>This inference is unsound because all cats, by definition, are mammals.'
