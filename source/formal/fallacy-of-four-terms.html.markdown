title: 'Fallacy of four terms'
text: "The fallacy of four terms (Latin: quaternio terminorum) is the formal fallacy that occurs when a syllogism has four (or more) terms rather than the requisite three. This form of argument is thus invalid."
example: "Categorical syllogisms always have three terms:<br/><br/>Major premise: All fish have fins.<br/>Minor premise: All goldfish are fish.<br/>Conclusion: All goldfish have fins.<br/><br/>Here, the three terms are: 'goldfish', 'fish', and 'fins'.<br/><br/>Using four terms invalidates the syllogism:<br/><br/>Major premise: All fish have fins.<br/>Minor premise: All goldfish are fish.<br/>Conclusion: All humans have fins.<br/><br/>The premises do not connect 'humans' with 'fins', so the reasoning is invalid. Notice that there are four terms: 'fish', 'fins', 'goldfish' and 'humans'. Two premises are not enough to connect four different terms, since in order to establish connection, there must be one term common to both premises."
