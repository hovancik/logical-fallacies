title: 'Negative conclusion from affirmative premises'
text: "Negative conclusion from affirmative premises is a syllogistic fallacy committed when a categorical syllogism has a negative conclusion yet both premises are affirmative. The inability of affirmative premises to reach a negative conclusion is usually cited as one of the basic rules of constructing a valid categorical syllogism."
example: "Premise: All colonels are officers.<br/>Premise: All officers are soldiers.<br/>Conclusion: Therefore, no colonels are soldiers."
