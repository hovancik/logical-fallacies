title: 'Affirmative conclusion from a negative premise'
text: "Affirmative conclusion from a negative premise (illicit negative) is a formal fallacy that is committed when a categorical syllogism has a positive conclusion, but one or two negative premises."
example: "No fish are dogs, and no dogs can fly, therefore all fish can fly.<br/><br/>The only thing that can be properly inferred from these premises is that some things that are not fish cannot fly, provided that dogs exist.<br/><br/>Or:<br/><br/>We don't read that trash. People who read that trash don't appreciate real literature. Therefore, we appreciate real literature."
