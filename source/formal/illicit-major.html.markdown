title: 'Illicit major'
text: "Illicit major is a formal fallacy committed in a categorical syllogism that is invalid because its major term is undistributed in the major premise but distributed in the conclusion."
example: "All dogs are mammals<br>No cats are dogs<br>Therefore, no cats are mammals<br><br>In this argument, the major term is 'mammals'. This is distributed in the conclusion (the last statement) because we are making a claim about a property of all mammals: that they are not cats. However, it is not distributed in the major premise (the first statement) where we are only talking about a property of some mammals: Only some mammals are dogs.<br><br>The error is in assuming that the converse of the first statement (that all mammals are dogs) is also true."
