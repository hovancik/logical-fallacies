title: 'Continuum fallacy'
text: "The continuum fallacy is an informal fallacy of assuming that the existence of a continuum of possible states between two binary positions means that said positions are not meaningfully different."
example: "Fred is clean-shaven now. If a person has no beard, one more day of growth will not cause them to have a beard. Therefore, Fred can never grow a beard."
