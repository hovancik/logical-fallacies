title: 'Argument from ignorance'
text: "Argument from ignorance (from Latin: argumentum ad ignorantiam), also known as appeal to ignorance (in which ignorance represents 'a lack of contrary evidence'), is a fallacy in informal logic. It asserts that a proposition is true because it has not yet been proven false (or vice versa)."
example: "Speaker A: Infectious diseases are caused by microbes.<br/>Speaker B: What a ridiculous idea!<br/>Speaker A: How so?<br/>Speaker B: It's obviously ridiculous.<br/><br/>Speaker B gives no evidence or reasoning, and when pressed, claims that Speaker A's statement is inherently absurd, thus applying the fallacy.."
