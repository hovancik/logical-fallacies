title: 'Burden of proof'
text: "Burden of Proof is an informal fallacy in which the burden of proof is placed on the wrong side. When two parties are in a discussion and one makes a claim that the other disputes, the one who makes the claim typically has a burden of proof to justify or substantiate that claim especially when it challenges a perceived status quo."
example: "Invisible teapot is, at this very moment, in orbit around the Sun between the Earth and Mars and that because no one can prove the assertion wrong it is therefore a valid one."
