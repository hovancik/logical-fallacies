title: 'Appeal to the stone'
text: 'Appeal to the stone is an informal fallacy that consists in dismissing a statement as absurd without giving proof of its absurdity.'
example: "Speaker A: Infectious diseases are caused by microbes.<br/>Speaker B: What a ridiculous idea!<br/>Speaker A: How so?<br/>Speaker B: It's obviously ridiculous.<br/><br/>Speaker B gives no evidence or reasoning, and when pressed, claims that Speaker A's statement is inherently absurd, thus applying the fallacy."
